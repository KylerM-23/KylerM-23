Hi I am Kyler Martinez and I am an engineer with a focus on computer engineering. By day testing stuff and by night going to school and making as much as possible. I am intrested in hardware devleopment using Verilog/SystemVerilog and embedded systems.

I 3D print as one of my hobbies, check out my Thingiverse to see more.
